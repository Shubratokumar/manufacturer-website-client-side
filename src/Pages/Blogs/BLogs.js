                        <p> Optimizing application performance is key for developers who are mindful of keeping a user’s experience positive to keep them on an app and engaged. Internally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI. While this will lead to a faster user interface without specifically optimizing for performance for many cases, there are ways where we can still speed up our React application. Some of important techniques for improving performance of React app are as follows:

                        <ul>
